Write a Java program to display "Hello there!" 5 times all in separate lines.

Ensure to declare the main class as public. BTW, main class is the class having main() method.



Notes:

1. Display output as instructed. Avoid displaying extra characters while taking input or displaying output. No need of providing input and output prompts, which are otherwise needed for an interactive program.


2. Ensure to indent all programs properly so that the blocks in the overall program are highly readable and each block can be distinguished from others. Please ensure to write 1-2 comments in small programs and more while writing medium to large programs.
