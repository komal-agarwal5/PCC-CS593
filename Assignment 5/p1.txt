Observe the following program carefully which is expected to create thread and compute factorial:


???

public class TestRunnable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Thread: Started");
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        
        MyThread mt1=new MyThread("Factorial", n); //Construct a runnable object

        Thread nt1=new Thread(mt1); //Construct a thread on that object
        nt1.start(); //Start running the thread

        System.out.println("Main Thread: Ended");
     }
}


Replace ??? with suitable lines so that the program can run as illustrated in the example.

Write only the missing part in the answer window. Avoid writing the full program / class, main() method, input / output handling or validation of inputs.
