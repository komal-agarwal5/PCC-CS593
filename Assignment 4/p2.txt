Imagine a factory with scrap pieces of different shapes. 

Compute area based on following valid shape types:

        1: Circle
        2: Rectangle


Quit the program when type is 0 and show "Invalid type" error otherwise.

Study the partly-developed program with Shape interface declaration and outputs for specific shape type with related dimension. 

Identify the missing parts in the program and write the whole program in the answer window.
